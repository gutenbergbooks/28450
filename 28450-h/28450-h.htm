<p class="pr1"><big><b>When he opened the door to the shed that day, and saw
the axe suspended in mid-air, he understood what was wrong.</b></big></p></div>

<p><span class="dcap">He had</span> been living with
us for a week before I found
out he was a Lifter. Even the
discovery was an accident. I
had started for the store, but
then remembered a chore I
wanted him to do. I heard the
sounds of wood-chopping
coming from the shed, so I
went behind the house to the
small wooden structure. I
must have gasped or something,
because he turned
around to look at me, dropping
the axe he had poised
over a block of wood as he
turned. Only he hadn't been
holding the axe; it had been
hanging in mid-air without
support.</p>

<p>The first time I saw him
was when he knocked on my
door. I don't think I'll ever
forget how he looked&mdash;tall
and thin, old clothes and older
shoes, an unruly mop of
blond hair. It was only when I
looked at his face that I realized
that he was more than a
mere boy of eighteen or nineteen.
The tired lines around
his mouth, the sad, mature
look in his eyes, the stoop already
evident in his young
shoulders; he had been forced
to mature too quickly, and
seemed to have knowledge a
boy his age had no right to be
burdened with.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I was wondering if I
might get a bite to eat, sir,"
he said.</p>

<p>I grinned. No matter how
he looked, he was no different
from anyone else his age
where food was concerned.
"Sure; come on in and rest a
spell," I told him. "Marty, can
you fix a plate of something?
We've got a guest." Marty&mdash;my
wife&mdash;glanced through the
kitchen doorway. After a cursory
look at the boy, she
smiled at him and went back
to work.</p>

<p>"Sit down, son, you look
pretty done-in. Come far today?"</p>

<p>He nodded. "Guess it
shows, huh?" he said, brushing
the road dust from his
trousers.</p>

<p>"Uh-huh. Where you from?
Not around here, I know."</p>

<p>"Far back as I can remember,
Oregon has been home."</p>

<p>It wasn't hard to guess why
he was almost a thousand
miles from home. During the
war, over ten million American
families had been separated,
their way of life destroyed
by the hell of atomic bombings.
Ever since its end, people
had been seeking their
loved ones; many, only to
find them dead or dying.
Sometimes the searches
stretched across continents or
oceans. In that respect the
boy sitting opposite me was
no different from hundreds
of others I've seen in the past
ten years. The only difference
was in his face.</p>

<p>"Looking for your family,"
I said, making it a statement.</p>

<p>"Yessir." He smiled, as
though the sentence had double
meaning.</p>

<p>After he had eaten, he went
down to the town store to
look through its records.
They all do. They turn the
pages of the big stopover
book, hoping a relative or
friend had passed through the
same town. Then they sign
the book, put down the date
and where they're headed, and
set out once more. Almost all
towns have stopover books
nowadays, and a good thing,
too. They helped me find
Marty back in '63, when the
truce was finally signed. In
fact, I found her right here in
this town. We got married,
settled down, and haven't
been more than a hundred
miles away since then.</p>

<p>Martha called me into the
kitchen almost as soon as he
was gone. "He's a nice boy."</p>

<p>"That he is," I agreed. "You
know, I've been thinking; we
could use a young fella
around here to help with the
work."</p>

<p>"If he'll stay. There was
something in his eyes; a sort
of longing for someone very
close to him. That kind usually
takes off after a night's
rest."</p>

<p>"I know. Guess I'll drop by
the store; see if I can talk
him into staying."</p>

<p>By the time I reached the
store, school was out, and a
group of kids were gathered
around him, listening to his
description of the Rocky
Mountains, which he had
crossed during the summer.
The kids weren't the only
ones listening. Even the
adults were standing around
in the store, remembering the
places they had once seen
themselves, and getting such
bits of news as he dropped
about the other towns he had
passed through. The Searchers
are, next to the town radio
stations, the only source of
information we have now, so
it's no wonder they're so
warmly greeted wherever they
stop.</p>

<p>Soon as he'd finished telling
about the Rockies, I said
we'd appreciate it if he would
stay for supper. He said he
would, and later, while he and
Tommy, my eight-year-old
son, and I were walking home,
I asked him if he'd stay with
us for a while.</p>

<p>For a moment he looked
wistful, as if wishing he
could stay here, and forget
whoever he was trying to
find. Then he smiled and said,
thanks, he would stay for a
week or so.</p>

<p>He was real helpful, too,
cutting stove and fireplace
wood for the coming winter,
running errands, hunting for
game animals, and teaching at
the school. Almost all Searchers
teach when they can be
persuaded to stay in town for
a spell. Since there are no
more colleges to produce
teachers, anyone who knows
something useful takes a turn
at teaching. 'Fore the war, I
was a mathematics major in
college, so twice a week I
teach all kinds of math at
school, from numbers through
calculus. Mostly, Searchers
teach about what the places
they had passed through are
like.</p>

<p>Then, when I opened the
door to the shed that day, and
saw the axe suspended in
mid-air, I suddenly realized
why he had that sad, tired
look about him all the time.</p>

<p>He picked up the axe from
where it had fallen, and stood
it against the wall. Reaching
for his jacket, he said, "I&mdash;I
guess I'd better be moving
along, Mr. Tranton. I'm really
sorry if I've caused you
any trouble." He started past
me for the door.</p>

<p>"Hold on, son." I grabbed
his arm. "Why the rush?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to cause you
any trouble. Now that you
know what I am&mdash;" he gritted the
words out bitterly, "the word
will get around. I wouldn't
want the others in town to be
angry with you because of
me. You and Mrs. Tranton
have been swell to me. Thanks
for everything." He tried to
pull his arm loose, but I held
fast.</p>

<p>"Let's go inside and have a
cup of coffee," I suggested. "I
don't know about the other
towns you've been through,
but here we don't hate a person
because he might happen
to have powers we don't."</p>

<p>"Yesterday I was down at
the store, and I heard one of
the men sounding off about
us," he said. "He didn't sound
like he cared much for us."</p>

<p>"Must have been John Atherson.
He never could understand
ESP, and he blames the
war on it. We just let him
talk; can't change a person
like that." We went up the
back steps and through the
door into the kitchen. "Go on,
show Marty," I said, taking
off my jacket.</p>

<p>He looked at me to make
sure I meant it. Then he
raised the coffee pot from the
stove, and watched it move
across the room under its own
power to the table where I
was sitting. Leaving the pot
in mid-air, he made the cupboard
open, and still standing
in the middle of the room,
floated three cups and saucers
to the table. Then he got
the cream, sugar and three
spoons, put them on the table,
and poured the coffee.
Marty watched the coffee pot
move back to the stove, her
mouth open in amazement, "I
heard of it, but I don't think
I'd have believed it if I hadn't
seen it." I nodded, and she
smiled at him. "Now that I
know," she said, "I'm even
gladder you chose to stay
here for a while."</p>

<p>He grinned. "Thanks." He
sat down with us at the table,
and stirred some sugar into
his coffee.</p>

<p>"It must be hard on you,"
Marty said quietly, in a knowing
way. "Are you really looking
for your family, or for
others with ESP?"</p>

<p>"My father was killed during
the bombings. After that,
Mom and I were alone. She
only had a little talent; Dad
and I were the ones who were
really adept. Anyway, we
stayed on the small farm we
owned until last spring. Then
Mom married again, and I was
free to leave. I think her new
husband was sorry to see me
go, because it meant a lot of
manual work for him that I
had been doing an easier way.
I decided to see if I couldn't
find any others like myself,
so I left and started across
the country."</p>

<p>"Do you have any other
powers, or can you just control
things?" Marty asked.</p>

<p>He grinned. "If you mean,
am I an all-around superman,
no. Dad wasn't either. I do
have a scattering of other psi
talents, though, but nothing
as well-developed as my telekinesis.
I'm still working on
them."</p>

<p>Tommy came in from
school just then. "Could you
teach him how to use his mind
that way, or do you have to
be born with it?" I said.</p>

<p>He smiled again. "No, you
don't have to be born with it.
Everyone could do it if they
started training themselves
young enough to use their
minds to the fullest extent.
All through history certain
people have had strange powers.
The trouble was, they
were thought to be freaks instead
of the better developed
humans they actually were.
Even now, we're only on the
threshold of learning the
full power of the mind." He
turned to Tommy. "Would
you like to learn how to do
things, Tommy?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Like what?"</p>

<p>He glanced at Marty and
me. "Like making the world a
better place to live."</p>

<p>Two weeks later, at a meeting
of the town council, I
wasn't too worried about getting
the proposal accepted.
We might have some trouble
with Atherson, but I figured
between the two of us we
could handle him. When the
new business came up, I stood
up and led Tommy to the
front of the hall. There were
a few whispers as we went, as
children under fifteen aren't
allowed in the hall during a
council meeting.</p>

<p>"Tommy has something to
say to you which, I think, will
interest everyone here. Go on,
son."</p>

<p>Seconds afterwards, we all
heard, a clear "Hello," but not
with our ears; the word came
from inside our heads.</p>

<p>Someone said: "The kid's a
telepath," and the silence was
broken.</p>

<p>Everybody was talking at
the same time.</p>

<p>"I suppose you think it's an
honor to have one of them
damn things for your son,"
Atherson yelled. "I'm glad
you're the one who got stuck,
and not me."</p>

<p>"Tommy was not <i>born</i> a
telepath, John," I told him.
"He has been <i>deliberately
trained</i> to make use of the latent
power in his brain. And I
don't think I'm 'stuck' either.
We all know we've been slowly
slipping into retrogression
ever since '63. None of us
like it, but there isn't anything
we can do to halt it&mdash;yet.
We don't want our children,
or their children, to
keep slipping backwards. If
we don't stop it in our lifetime,
we may not be able to
stop it at all.</p>

<p>"As I see it, the best chance
we have to at least achieve a
status quo is to accept the
aid those among us with psi
talents are willing to give. After
all, it's their world, too.
With their help, we may be
able to build a better civilization,
one without the socio-political
diseases that led to
the war.</p>

<p>"The young man who has
been staying at my house for
the past three weeks taught
Tommy to do what he just
did. He says he thinks he can
do it with any child under ten
years old, and is even willing
to try it with some teen-agers.
Of course, Tommy's training
has just begun. He will keep
on learning for years.</p>

<p>"Here's my idea. If some of
the children get a grounding
in how to develop their dormant
brain power, by the time
they're twenty, they'll be able
to mold a new society, one
geared to the present culture
instead of the past traditions.
How about it?"</p>

<p>I waited. For a minute there
was silence. Finally one of
the older men stood up. "Is
he sure he can do it?"</p>

<p>"All we know is it worked
with Tommy," I replied.</p>

<p>"I don't like it; it's unnatural,"
Atherson said.</p>

<p>"No one asked you to like
it," someone said.</p>

<p>Another called: "Do you
think three world wars in fifty
years <i>is</i> natural? Let's take
a vote."</p>

<p>A vote was taken, and it
was decided to add an extra
class for those children whose
parents wanted them to attend.
After a month, the
council would expect a report
on what progress&mdash;or lack of
it&mdash;had been made.</p>

<hr />

<p>A few weeks later,
when my math class was over,
I hung around to watch the
new class. It was divided into
small groups, each training on
a different psi talent. One
group was lifting pencils and
gently returning them to
desks by telekinesis. Another
was sitting quietly, once in a
while breaking into shouts of
laughter; probably telepathy.
There were other groups, but
I didn't know enough about
the talents to identify their
work.</p>

<p>During the time he was
teaching, he met a girl. They
spent quite a bit of time together,
and she joined the
special class. By the time the
report to the council came
due, it wasn't hard to tell they
were in love.</p>

<p>Just about everyone in town
turned out for that meeting.
The boys and girls who were
taking the class were seated
at the front of the hall. The
report was first on the agenda,
so the kids could go home
to bed.</p>

<p>"When we started," he
said, "I asked those children
who weren't interested, or
who were&mdash;um&mdash;unsuited to
the work, to leave. Then we
ran through a general training
exercise, and after a week,
I split the class up into
groups. Each group was to
concentrate on one talent, but
general sessions for the entire
class give everyone practice
in all talents. I think we've
made fairly good progress.
Some of the older teen-agers
have shown an interest in the
talents (he glanced at his
girl), and although progress
has not been as rapid as with
the younger children, they are
sufficiently developed to help
instruct. Now your children
are going to demonstrate
what they have learned."</p>

<p>For the next half hour we
watched Tommy and fourteen
other boys and girls work.
Tommy and the others who
had concentrated on telepathy
read silently to us from
books and talked to each other,
projecting their thoughts
so we could also listen in.
The telekinesis group all
worked together to build a
small table. All the necessary
materials were stacked at the
front of the room. The kids
sat in a half circle, their
brows furrowed in concentration
as lumber, nails and
hammers moved under the
guidance of their minds.
When they had finished, the
table was complete, even to
the sanding and a coat of varnish.</p>

<p>Finally, the only one with
precognition&mdash;a girl about six
years old, with long blonde
hair&mdash;gave the weather forecast
for the next two weeks.
Copies of her prediction were
passed out to us, so we could
check her accuracy.</p>

<p>Once the kids were gone, he
stood up again. "I hope you
are all convinced as to what
can be accomplished through
the use of psi. The talents can
and should be used for the
betterment of society, not for
carnival side shows. Of
course, there are more than
those just demonstrated. Unfortunately,
I couldn't find
them present in this group. I
was hoping for either a healer
or a sensitive, but no one had
the necessary ability.</p>

<p>"If you want the class continued,
the decision is yours.
Thanks for having open
minds, and for giving me a
chance." He picked up his
jacket and walked out.</p>

<p>Atherson didn't bother to
come to the meeting, so the
vote to continue the class was
unanimous.</p>

<p>He stayed on, teaching part-time,
helping out with the
work at my place, and seeing
his girl. Then, one afternoon
two weeks after the council
meeting, she came to see me.
"You've got to stop him, Mr.
Tranton," she said. "He's going
to leave. He told me he
was going right after he finished
the class today. He's
probably down at the store
right now, buying things to
take with him. You've got to
make him stay."</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked quietly,
watching the tears well up in
her eyes. She hadn't lost her
composure yet, but she felt so
strongly about him she was
on the verge of breaking
down.</p>

<p>"Because I love him and he
loves me," she retorted.
"That's why. Won't you talk
to him? At least get him to
take me with him. Please."</p>

<p>"You said you love him.
Would you rather he stayed
here, and was never fully happy,
or left to continue searching,
maybe to return someday,
ready to settle down? If you
really love him there's no
question."</p>

<p>"Couldn't he take me with
him?"</p>

<p>I shook my head. "I don't
think you should even ask
him to take you. You'd be a
burden that would slow him
down. He'd worry about you,
have to get your food, find
shelter for you. He might let
you go with him, but don't ask
him to. He's too young to be
tied down. Now go on, and
wish him good luck and kiss
him goodbye. He's coming up
the road now."</p>

<p>She glanced out the open
window, jumped up, and ran
out into the sunlight, to wait
at the side of the road. I
picked up the book I had been
reading, but the window was
too close to the road for me
to concentrate on the pages.
She didn't say anything until
he was standing before her.</p>

<p>"I'll be waiting," she said.
"Take care of yourself."</p>

<p>He nodded. "I have to go,"
he told her. "Partly because it
was Dad's last wish, partly because
I need others of my
own kind. Alone, we can't
help the world much; together,
there's a good chance for
results. I left a letter for the
council saying you were going
to take over the class, because
you have the ability to
carry on. Watch Cathy, and
help her all you can. She's got
it; her weather forecast
proved that much. You've got
to drum that into her; never
let her forget it. Maybe I'll
be back&mdash;I hope so. But first,
I have to find others. I need
them, and they might need
me. We're still not completely
self-sufficient.</p>

<p>"Give the kids my love, and
keep them at it. Just don't
forget they <i>are</i> kids. Give
them a chance to grow up as
normally as possible. That's
a chance I didn't have."</p>

<p>He kissed her tenderly, then
started off down the road.
When he reached the crest of
the hill, he turned and waved.
Marty joined me at the doorway,
and we waved too. Outlined
against the bright blue
afternoon sky, he stood immobile
for a moment. To many,
he would have been just a
young man with a tired-out
face; but to me, the symbol of
a better life for Tommy and
his children ... a life unmarred
by the threat of instant
death as punishment for
something he had little control
over.</p>

<p>He's gone now, but the
work will go on, and the Athersons
of the world will come
to realize he is giving us
another chance, a chance we
don't really deserve. Somehow
he reminds me of another
man. A man who said: "Suffer
the little children to come
unto me, and forbid them not;
for of such is the kingdom of
God."</p>
